  abstract = {Today's ensemble weather prediction systems provide reliable and sharp probabilistic forecasts{\textemdash}yet they are still rarely communicated to outside users because of two main worries: the difficulty of communicating probabilities to lay audiences and their presumed reluctance to use probabilistic forecasts. To bridge the gap between the forecasts available and their use in day-to-day decision making, we encourage scientists, developers, and end-users to engage in interdisciplinary collaborations. Here, we discuss our experience with three different approaches of introducing probabilistic forecasts to different user groups and the theoretical and practical challenges that emerged. The approaches range from quantitative analyses of users' revealed preferences online to a participatory developer{\textendash}user dialogue based on trial cases and interactive demonstration tools. The examples illustrate three key points. First, to make informed decisions, users need access to probabilistic forecasts. Second, forecast uncertainty can be understood if its visual representations follow validated best practices from risk communication and information design; we highlight five important recommendations from that literature for communicating probabilistic forecasts. Third, to appreciate the value of probabilistic forecasts for their decisions, users need the opportunity to experience them in their everyday practice. With these insights and practical pointers, we hope to support future efforts to integrate probabilistic forecasts into everyday decision making.},

  abstract = {In North America and Europe, most fatalities due to snow avalanches occur in the backcountry during recreational pursuits. Of these, more than 90\% of the fatal avalanches are triggered by the victims themselves. This pattern suggests that the primary cause of avalanche fatalities for human-triggered avalanches is a failure in human perception. For the latter, people thought that the state of stability or instability of the snow cover was different than it actually was. In this paper, the strength and weight of evidence used to make decisions in backcountry travel are discussed from: (a) the perspective of the favored hypothesis to proceed for good recreational enjoyment based on stability evaluation and (b) the null hypothesis based on an assessment of instability. Based on the facts about snow slab avalanche release, it is argued that instability analysis is the best framework for avalanche forecasting, whereas human action is most closely related to the favored hypothesis (stability evaluation). Using scaling laws derived from: (a) fracture mechanics about the size of imperfections causing avalanches and (b) avalanche dimensions, it is suggested that a snow slab could show stability over more than 99\% of the total area. From the concepts of Bayesian probability, it is shown that overconfidence about stability can arise when the weight of the likelihood is high and the weight of prior is low. Similarly, underconfidence (excessive conservatism) often results when the weight of the prior is high with little regard for the likelihood, which may be low. Overconfidence about stability is considered to be a prime source of accidents.},

  abstract = {The European Avalanche Danger Scale provides definitions for each of the five danger levels. However, some terms used in the scale are not fully defined, which might lead to inconsistent assessments and communication of avalanche danger among different forecasting services, but also within the same team of forecasters. Already in 2005, the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS) introduced the Bavarian Matrix (BM) as an auxiliary tool to overcome these inconsistencies. However, some of the cells of the matrix are still not fully accepted and discussed within the EAWS. Discussions among forecasters revealed that the ambiguous definitions of the terms applied within the BM are the main reason for the debate on these cells. In 2010, the North American avalanche community implemented a revised version of the avalanche danger scale and declared its first and foremost purpose is public risk communication. The Conceptual Model of Avalanche Hazard (CMAH) was developed as part of the revision process in North America. It describes the process of avalanche danger assessment in a comprehensive manner. The strength of the CMAH is its streamlined structure and definition of the individual terms used and its integration of avalanche problems. Although all applied terms map directly to the North American Avalanche Danger Scale, the CMAH fails to provide a danger level at the end of the assessment process, which again might lead to different assessments. Therefore, we propose a merge of the two concepts, CMAH and BM. Our merge resulted in the Avalanche Danger Assessment Matrix (ADAM), which consists of a likelihood-matrix and a danger-matrix based on the NA definitions. We also provide a link to the terms used within the EAWS.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In many countries with seasonally snow-covered mountain ranges warnings are issued to alert the public about imminent avalanche danger, mostly employing a 5-level danger scale. However, as avalanche danger cannot be measured, the charac-terization of avalanche danger remains qualitative. The probability of avalanche occurrence in combination with the ex-pected avalanche type and size decide on the degree of danger in a given forecast region ({$\greaterequivlnt$}\,100\,km2). To describe ava-lanche occurrence probability the snowpack stability and its spatial distribution need to be assessed. To quantify the rela-tion between avalanche occurrence and avalanche danger level we analyzed a large data set of visually observed ava-lanches from the region of Davos (Eastern Swiss Alps), all with mapped outlines, and compared the avalanche activity to the forecast danger level on the day of occurrence. The number of avalanches per day strongly increased with increasing danger level confirming that not only the release probability but also the frequency of locations with a weakness in the snowpack where avalanches may initiate from, increases within a region. Avalanche size did in general not increase with increasing avalanche danger level, suggesting that avalanche size may be of secondary importance compared to snowpack stability and its distribution when assessing the danger level. Moreover, the frequency of wet-snow avalanches was found to be higher than the frequency of dry-snow avalanches on a given day; also, wet-snow avalanches tended to be larger. This finding may indicate that the danger scale is not used consistently with regard to avalanche type. Although, observed ava-lanche occurrence and avalanche danger level are subject to uncertainties, our findings on the characteristics of avalanche activity may allow revisiting the definitions of the European avalanche danger scale. The description of the danger levels can be improved, in particular by quantifying some of the many proportional quantifiers. For instance, `many avalanches', expected at danger level 4{\textendash}High, means on the order of 10 avalanches per 100\,km2. Whereas our data set is one of the most comprehensive, visually observed avalanche records are known to be inherently incomplete so that our results often refer to a lower limit and should be confirmed using other similarly comprehensive data sets.},

  abstract = {A complete understanding of the fundamental concepts of avalanche hazard, danger and risk should become basic requirements for anyone undertaking avalanche prediction and risk control. However, existing definitions of hazard and risk (CSA, 1997) offer only limited value to operational practitioners such as avalanche forecasters and mountain guides. This discussion brings a field-based perspective to the underlying risk constructs of probability, consequence and exposure, and places them into a practical context that explains their relevance to everyday forecasting and mountain travel. It is hoped that a more universal understanding of these concepts will lead to an improved focus on risk in avalanche education, operational practices based on risk, and published standards for operational avalanche risk control. By aligning the practice of avalanche forecasting to be consistent with other risk-based disciplines, both professionals and the public will benefit from a clearer explanation and more thorough understanding of the fundamentals contributing to avalanche risk.},

  abstract = {This conceptual model of avalanche hazard identifies the key components of avalanche hazard and structures them into a systematic, consistent workflow for hazard and risk assessments. The method is applicable to all types of avalanche forecasting operations, and the underlying principles can be applied at any scale in space or time. The concept of an avalanche problem is introduced, describing how different types of avalanche problems directly influence the assessment and management of the risk. Four sequential questions are shown to structure the assessment of avalanche hazard, namely: (1) What type of avalanche problem(s) exists? (2) Where are these problems located in the terrain? (3) How likely is it that an avalanche will occur? and (4) How big will the avalanche be? Our objective was to develop an underpinning for qualitative hazard and risk assessments and address this knowledge gap in the avalanche forecasting literature. We used judgmental decomposition to elicit the avalanche forecasting process from forecasters and then described it within a risk-based framework that is consistent with other natural hazards disciplines.},
